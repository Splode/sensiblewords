# Sensible Words

> A quote a day. That simple.

With this project, I aimed to create an app that served a quote a day from a curated list of my favorite quotes. It was my first project to use JavaScript for anything beyond simple styling.

## Features
- Serves up a new quote everyday.
- Built with jQuery.
